# Assignment Completion Report

**Project Name:** Contractor Job & Work Order Management Module  
**Date of Completion:** January 14, 2026

## 1. Development Overview
This project was developed as a full-stack solution using **React (Vite)** for the frontend and **Node.js (Express)** with **MongoDB** for the backend. The application features independent dashboards for Agents and Contractors, real-time status tracking, and a secure payment confirmation workflow.

## 2. AI Usage Disclosure
While the core architecture, logic, and design were manually implemented, AI tools were utilized for specific technical optimizations and utility features.

- **AI Tools Used:** Google Gemini.
- **Core Manual Implementation (approx. 90%):**
    - Architecture and Component Structure.
    - Database Schema Design (Users, Jobs, Requests).
    - Core Authentication and Role-based Logic.
    - UI/UX Design and Tailwind CSS Styling.
    - API Integration and State Management.
- **AI-Assisted Features (approx. 10%):**
    - Generation of initial standard page structure and boilerplate components.
    - Implementation of PDF generation logic for payment receipts.
    - Troubleshooting production-specific configurations.

## 4. Manual Refinement & Finalization
While AI assisted with generating basic starting points for some pages, all code was thoroughly reviewed, debugged, and significantly edited manually to ensure it met project requirements, design standards, and functional consistency.

## 3. Total Time Taken
- **Total Development Time:** 10 Hours  
*(Includes planning, database modeling, frontend/backend development, testing, and deployment)*

---
**Summary:** The majority of the application logic and user interface was hand-coded. AI was selectively used to accelerate the implementation of specialized modules and ensure secure deployment configurations.
